## Overview

This contains my preparation guide. Note there were two regimens I followed; depending on circumstance. One was general use, for when I did not have a specific interview/company to prepare. I [followed this](#general-cadence) until I landed an interview, in which case I'd switch gears and [narrow my focus and cadence](#preparing-for-a-specific-interview) to only activities directly related to the role.

### Quick Resources

Below are quick links to mentioned resources. I'll explain in more detail how I used each of these and any related activities. Do pay for these resources to unlock all features. This is an investment in your career and the ROI is significant, making them well worth the cost.

## Technical Practice Problems

I do not recommend LeetCode for practice problems. Instead, use [1](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions). The problems are all directly related to front-end development, with a mix of UI and non-UI problems. LeetCode does not even support UI problems, which is essential for front-end roles.

- Do practice and interview in JavaScript, not TypeScript ([why?](#use-javascript-not-typescript))
- Practice problems with 45 minute time limit (except for [start of journey and warm-up problems](#getting-started-and-warm-up-problems))
- Don't worry about tracking completion time; see [what to do instead](#not-tracking-progress-and-what-to-do-instead)
- [Perfect practice](#perfect-practice): solving the problem **AND** doing so while talking (out loud) through the process
- Occasionally rework problems you've already completed

### Use JavaScript, not TypeScript

Despite using TypeScript in production, I highly recommend **practicing and using JavaScript when interviewing**. Why? The real-world benefits of TypeScript are not nearly as applicable in an interview; time management is. You have a very limited time and your goal is to maximize the opportunity to demonstrate your skills. TypeScript requires additional effort to use, e.g., typing the types (literal keyboard typing). You most likely will either have one of two things occur: either you type properly and spend precious time writing this all out or you type everything as `any` in which case you may as well have used JavaScript. My recommendation is to mention that in a production environment, you favor TypeScript, but recognize the time constraints of the interview and therefore opt to use JavaScript instead. This signals to the interviewer that you are aware of TypeScript, its benefits and trade-offs, despite not using it in the actual interview.

### Getting Started and Warm-Up Problems

If you're newly doing these problems, it can be really discouraging how long they take to complete; especially if you're timing them to a real interview length (45 mins). When I first started, I timed myself working problems, but did NOT time box myself. This not only gave me a baseline, helped give me confidence, and also gave me info on problem areas I'd have to focus on to fit problems within a real interview time (45 minutes).

Some days, I would also work a warm-up problem before any others. These were normally easier problems that are also very short to work; just to get me in the right head space.

### Not Tracking Progress and What to do Instead

> **tl;dr**: don't worry about tracking your progress over time. Focus on working problems and learning from each one on what to focus on next.

When I first started, I wanted to keep track of my progress over time. I wanted to see how long it took me to complete problems, so I could see if, on average, I was under about 30 minutes per problem. I created a fancy Excel spreadsheet, timed myself, and kept record of problem IDs and the time to complete them. In the end, I did not find this as useful and I certainly didn't keep it up the entire time.

I do recommend timing yourself for every problem; simply don't worry about recording the completion time. Most problems that extended significantly beyond 45 mins, I would notate and revisit again in the near future. If a problem was consistently over the time limit, I may opt to skip it entirely. You have to remember, you have a finite prep time and you want to maximize your problem exposure and ability to work them. While revisiting hard problems can be helpful, if they consistently are defeating, then that is a sign to simply move on to another.

### Perfect Practice

One tripping point for me was that I initially practiced only solving problems in 45 minutes. However, I did so without my thought process/dialog being out loud. What I found, was when in a real interview setting, I tended to make small talk while working. This interfered with my actual thought process; leaving me spending time talking out loud, but without actually thinking through the problem. This ate up my time in a big way. The take away: practice doesn't make perfect...perfect practice makes perfect. Ensure you practice with real conditions in mind. If you're to be expected to work a problem and vocalize your thoughts as you go along...then that is what you do with every practice problem...talking. out. loud. This will improve your ability to not only articulate ideas, but also how to do so without it being a stream of conscious thought that may be difficult to follow.

## Front-end Systems Design Problems

## General Cadence

> Note, if I had an upcoming interview, then I changed my cadence. See [preparing for a specific interview](#preparing-for-a-specific-interview) for more details.

I typically worked 4 hours of problems 3 days week. I spent most of that time on technical problems; maybe 70% on tech problems and 30% on systems design problems.

## Preparing for a Specific Interview

If I had an interview coming up, then I focused my practice and efforts specifically for it. I looked at tagged problems and thought what type of problems may be most relevant for the position in question. Sometimes recruiters will prep you with vague instructions; use these. If they say to focus on hashes, arrays, and maps, then you know what filters to apply. For an upcoming interview, I prioritized what was in the current round and the order in which the round happened. If a systems design interview was first, then I focused on that first, etc. If they were the same day, then I split my focus roughly 60/40 (tech and systems design).

I strove to only interview for a single company on a given day. There may be multiple interviews that day, but they would all be for only one company. I always joined the meeting 5 minutes before starting time. I also allocated the prior 30 minutes to the interview to center and relax. Thing to note, by relax, this does not include anything that requires focus; playing a game, etc. I did not want any distractions to pull me out of the right head space. I also work up early the day of (5:30 am but this can vary for others). I spent the extra time in the morning talking through questions I may be asked, etc. (out loud) in a conversational manner. This was very informally done (emphasis on conversational).
