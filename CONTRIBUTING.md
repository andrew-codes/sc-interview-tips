# Contributing Guidelines

I heavily encourage others to contribute their experiences, tips, and recommendations to this content base. It is for this reason, the content and repo structure is minimal; consisting of mostly directories and markdown files.

## Requesting Information

Please open a GitHub issue with any details of information you feel is missing or is needed.

## Providing Information

Please fork and open a PR into the `main` branch. To improve discoverability, please consider heavy usage of linking content. I would favor not having to skim directories of files, but rather navigate to content via the [README](./README.md) entrypoint.

If you plan to write a full-length topic, please place it and all related assets in a directory for this topic. The file name is README.md with all related assets in the parent directory (sub-directories are ok). Nesting topics (directories) within directories for further organizational purposes is acceptable. Please also ensure you include the following front matter:

1. Title: Title of Topic (title case)
2. Author: Name <@github-username>
3. Status: writing (in progress), revising (seeking others' input), completed
4. Tags: list of relevant topic tags
