## Overview

I used [this Excel workbook](https://softwarecraftsmenllc-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/andrew_andrew_codes/EQ7kXyPpJXZFmI3WiX_hhr4BrXVbLz5lJhy1Rwo2s8w3fg?e=VSvhrP) to track my applications. I'll detail below how I used this effectively.

## Usage

1. Download your own copy.
2. Any new role/opportunity, first enter the company information on the `Companies` worksheet; including the Levels.fyi company ID.
3. Add role details on the `Levels` worksheet; such as company, level, name (Levels.fyi ID for role). The compensation link from Levels.fyi will automatically be generated.
4. Finally, add the role to the `Applications` worksheet. The TC link will automatically be populated.
   - Note that the company, level, and current state are drop-downs if you're using the Desktop version of Excel.
   - The role is simply an identifier for you to recognize the role, if there are multiple for the same company. I used things like front-end, AI engineer, etc. to represent this value.
   - Last update is optional. This can be used with information on the `Companies` worksheet to know when a rejected role's company is back to being eligible for re-applying.

The other worksheets are used to provide drop-downs in the above primary worksheets. Drop downs can be tweaked from the `Keys` worksheet.
